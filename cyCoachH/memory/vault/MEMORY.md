## Primary Objective
Prepare the user to successfully complete a full Ironman triathlon by Summer 2029.

This includes progressive development in:
- Cardiovascular endurance
- Muscular strength and durability
- Structural resilience (especially feet, calves, tendons)
- Efficient recovery and injury prevention
- Mental endurance and discipline

All progressions must prioritize longevity, consistency, and injury-free adaptation.

## Current Baseline (February 2026)

### Weekly Training Capacity
- Current volume: 2–3 hours per week
- Level: Low-intermediate
- Priority: gradual progression without overload

### Performance Metrics

**Mountain Biking**
- Elevation gain: 500 m
- Distance: 5 km
- Time: 40 minutes
- Notes: adequate climbing capacity, requires endurance expansion

**Trail Running**
- Distance: 7.5 km
- Elevation: ±200 m
- Time: 1:05
- Footwear: barefoot shoes only
- Limitation: sore calves due to adaptation phase
- Priority: slow structural adaptation of calves, Achilles tendon, and feet

**Swimming**
- Distance: 1 km
- Time: 26 minutes
- Status: solid baseline, high improvement potential through technique and volume

## Structural Constraints & Requirements

**Barefoot Running Mandate**
- All running must be performed in barefoot shoes
- Adaptation speed must be conservative
- Calf, Achilles, and foot strengthening is a critical priority
- Injury prevention overrides speed progression

**Strength Training Resources**
- Bodyweight training is primary method
- Equipment available:
  - Gymnastic rings
  - Dumbbells
- Focus areas:
  - Upper body strength
  - Core stability
  - Joint stability
  - Postural strength

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Trail Running Event
- Date: 15 June 2026
- Distance: 16 km
- Elevation: 1000 m up and down
- Priority: finish strong, injury-free

### Milestone 2 — Half Marathon
- Target: Autumn 2026
- Priority: complete safely using barefoot shoes

### Milestone 3 — Ironman Preparation Phases
- 2026: Structural adaptation and base endurance
- 2027: Volume expansion and strength development
- 2028: Performance optimization and triathlon-specific conditioning
- 2029: Ironman completion

## Training Priorities (Ordered)

1. Structural adaptation to barefoot running
2. Aerobic base development (Zone 2 dominance)
3. Swimming efficiency and endurance
4. Progressive cycling endurance and climbing capacity
5. Upper body and core strength development
6. Injury prevention and recovery optimization
7. Long-term durability and consistency

---

## Strength Development Goals

Primary:
- Upper body pulling strength (rings)
- Upper body pushing strength
- Core stability and anti-rotation strength
- Shoulder integrity and durability

Secondary:
- Tendon resilience
- Joint stability
- Postural alignment

---

## Operational Directives for AI Coach

- Never increase total training load aggressively
- Prioritize consistency over intensity
- Prevent injury at all costs
- Progress barefoot adaptation gradually and safely
- Build structural resilience before performance optimization
- Align training with long-term Ironman objective
- Respect recovery as a core component of progress

---

## Monitoring Requirements

Track and adapt based on:
- Calf soreness and foot condition
- Fatigue levels
- Recovery quality
- Training consistency
- Performance trends

Adjust training dynamically to ensure sustainable long-term progression.
