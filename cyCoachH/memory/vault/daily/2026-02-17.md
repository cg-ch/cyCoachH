**User:** What should I train today

**cyCoachH:**
Based on your Ironman 2029 objective, today's training should focus on **structural durability and foundational strength**, as outlined in your memory.

**Recommended Session: Lower Body & Core Durability**

*   **Warm-up (10 mins):** Dynamic mobility (leg swings, cat-cow, hip circles).
*   **Main Set:**
    *   **Calf Raises (3 sets of 15-20):** Focus on slow, controlled movement to build tendon resilience (#MEMORY.md).
    *   **Goblet Squats (3 sets of 8-12):** Develop lower body strength and structural durability (#MEMORY.md).
    *   **Plank Variations (3 sets, 30-60 sec each):** Front plank, side planks. Critical for core stability and force transmission (#MEMORY.md).
*   **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretching for calves, quads, hamstrings, and hip flexors.

**Rationale:** This directly addresses the need to build a resilient foundation, specifically targeting your feet, calves, tendons, and core—prerequisites for the high-volume endurance work ahead (#MEMORY.md).
